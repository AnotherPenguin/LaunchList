<h3>Choose a launch vehicle.</h3>

<p class="contentBlurb">
It’s now time to select a launch vehicle! If you picked a large spacecraft, we assume that you are going to buy your own launch vehicle. If you picked a smaller spacecraft, you have the option to launch rideshare. This means that you launch with a bigger satellite. It’s much cheaper, but you don’t get to control where you go, so the time required to get to your target may be much more.
<br />
<br />

Evaluate the launch vehicles below based upon cost (shown) and the capacity to GTO. Capacity to GTO gives an example of how much power the launch vehicle has. More power means that it takes less time to get to your target. The most capacity to GTO rocket will get your to your target asteroid the fastest.
