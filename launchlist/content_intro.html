<h3>Welcome to Launch Vehicle Selection and Trade Analysis!</h3>

<p class="contentBlurb">
In this simulation, you get to be the program manager for an exciting space science program. Your science mission is assigned, but you get to choose how to meet the science objectives. As program manager, you get to choose whether the science objectives, the cost of the mission or the time to complete the mission is the most important. This is an analysis that spacecraft mission managers complete everyday at places like NASA, Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

Your mission is to verify the presence of water on an asteroid. Finding water on an asteroid is an important science objective because water is the building block for many applications; Water can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen, the fuel and oxidizer that powers rockets. If you can successfully identify water on asteroid, that asteroid could become a future fuel station, where spacecraft stop for additional fuel before powering on to the rest of the solar system. This is your mission for this simulation. 
<br />
<br />

To achieve this mission, you have to select: a) a target asteroid, b) a spacecraft design (based on size) and c) a launch vehicle to get into space. Your selections are evaluated for cost, time and meeting science objectives. As in real life, there is no best answer - there is the cheapest solution, the one that gets the most science and the one that takes the least time to answer the question. Itâ€™s up to you to decide which mission structure is best to achieve the goal of finding water on an asteroid.
