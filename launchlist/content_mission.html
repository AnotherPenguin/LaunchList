        <td class="desc_spacecraft">This asteroid, discovered in 1999, is a 500-meter asteroid, which is very close to earth. It is relatively close to earth and has a very similar orbit. This makes it easy to get to, but because it crosses the earth’s path it is also a potential threat. The proximity to the sun makes the likelihood of discovering water ice near the surface low, you’d need to look hard to have any chance of finding water here.</td>
